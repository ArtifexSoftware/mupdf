/*
 * General use
 *
 * This library uses threads but is not thread safe for the caller. All
 * calls should be made from a single thread. Some calls allow the user
 * to arrange for their own functions to be called back from the library;
 * often the users functions will be called back from a different thread. If
 * a call into the library is required in response to information from a
 * callback, it is the responsibility of the user to arrange for those
 * library calls to be made on the same thread as for other library calls.
 * Calls back into the library from a callback are not permitted.
 *
 * There are two main modes of use. In interactive windowing systems, it
 * is usual for the app developers code to be called on the main UI thread.
 * It is from the UI thread that all library calls should be made. Such
 * systems usually provide a way to post a call onto the UI thread. That
 * is the best way to respond to a callback from the library.
 *
 * The other mode of use is for plain executables that might wish to
 * (say) generate images of all the pages of a document. This can
 * be achieved, without use of callbacks, using the few synchronous
 * calls. E.g., MuOfficeDoc_getNumPages will wait for background document
 * loading to complete before returning the total number of pages and
 * MuOfficeRender_destroy will wait for background rendering to complete
 * before returning.
