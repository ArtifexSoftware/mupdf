Introduction
============

MuPDF can be used in two ways with Javascript as follows:

- With ``mutool run``.
- With `mupdf.js <https://mupdfjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package for Node and browsers.

Both ways are very similar and here we show code samples and the documentation
for both. However if a function or class is specific to only one environment,
then it is marked with the |only_mutool| or |only_mupdfjs| tags.
