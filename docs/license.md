## Open Source

MuPDF is licensed under the [GNU AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

This is a complex license that allows you to use MuPDF to build your own
projects for free, with no warranty and no support. It imposes many conditions
on users, including the need to release the full source code for systems built
with it.

Please ensure that you can comply with the conditions of the AGPL license.

See [Artifex licensing guide](https://artifex.com/licensing) if you have questions.

## Commercial

For those users that cannot (or do not want to) comply with the terms of the
GNU AGPL, it is also offered under a commercial license. This completely frees
users from the complexities imposed by the GNU AGPL.

commercial license.
