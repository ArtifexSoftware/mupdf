<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
The latest development source is available directly from the git repository:

<pre>
git clone --recursive git://git.ghostscript.com/mupdf.git
</pre>

<p>
In the mupdf directory, update the third party libraries:

<pre>
git submodule update --init
</pre>

<h2>Compiling on Windows</h2>

<p>
On Windows there is a Visual Studio project file in <tt>platform/win32/mupdf.vcproj</tt>.

<h2>Compiling on Linux</h2>

<p>
If you are compiling from source you will need several third party libraries:
freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. These libraries are contained
in the source archive. If you are using git, they are included as git
submodules.

<p>
You will also need the X11 headers and libraries if you're building on Linux.
These can typically be found in the xorg-dev package. Alternatively, if you
only want the command line tools, you can build with HAVE_X11=no.

<p>
The new OpenGL-based viewer also needs OpenGL headers and libraries. If you're
building on Linux, install the mesa-common-dev, libgl1-mesa-dev packages, and
libglu1-mesa-dev packages. You'll also need several X11 development packages:
xorg-dev, libxcursor-dev, libxrandr-dev, and libxinerama-dev. To skip building
the OpenGL viewer, build with HAVE_GLUT=no.

<p>
To install the viewer, command line tools, libraries, and header files on your system:

<pre>
make prefix=/usr/local install
</pre>

<p>
To install only the command line tools, libraries, and headers invoke make like this:

<pre>
make HAVE_X11=no HAVE_GLUT=no prefix=/usr/local install
</pre>
