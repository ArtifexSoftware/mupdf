:title:`mutool draw`
==========================================



The `draw` command will render a document to image files, convert to another vector format, or extract the text content.


- The supported input document formats are: `pdf`, `xps`, `cbz`, and `epub`.

- The supported output image formats are: `pbm`, `pgm`, `ppm`, `pam`, `png`, `pwg`, `pcl` and `ps`.

- The supported output vector formats are: `svg`, `pdf`, and `debug trace` (as `xml`).

- The supported output text formats are: `plain text`, `html`, and structured text (as `xml` or `json`).

`[options]`
   Options are as follows:

   `-p` password
      Use the specified password if the file is encrypted.
   `-o` output
      The output file name. The output format is inferred from the output filename. Embed `%d` in the name to indicate the page number (for example: "page%d.png"). Printf modifiers are supported, for example "%03d". If no output is specified, the output will go to `stdout`.
   `-F` format
      Enforce a specific output format. Only necessary when outputting to `stdout` since normally the output filename is used to infer the output format.
   `-R` angle
      Rotate clockwise by given number of degrees.
   `-r` resolution
      Render the page at the specified resolution. The default resolution is 72 dpi.
   `-w` width
      Render the page at the specified width (or, if the `-r` flag is used, render with a maximum width).
   `-h` height
      Render the page at the specified height (or, if the `-r` flag is used, render with a maximum height).
   `-f`
      Fit exactly; ignore the aspect ratio when matching specified width/heights.
   `-B` bandheight
      Render in banded mode with each band no taller than the given height. This uses less memory during rendering. Only compatible with `pam`, `pgm`, `ppm`, `pnm` and `png` output formats. Banded rendering and md5 checksumming may not be used at the same time.
   `-W` width
      Page width in points for :title:`EPUB` layout.
   `-H` height
      Page height in points for :title:`EPUB` layout.
   `-S` size
      Font size in points for :title:`EPUB` layout.
   `-U` filename
      User CSS stylesheet for :title:`EPUB` layout.
   `-X`
      Disable document styles for :title:`EPUB` layout.
   `-c` colorspace
      Render in the specified colorspace. Supported colorspaces are: `mono`, `gray`, `grayalpha`, `rgb`, `rgbalpha`, `cmyk`, `cmykalpha`. Some abbreviations are allowed: `m`, `g`, `ga`, `rgba`, `cmyka`. The default is chosen based on the output format.
   `-G` gamma
      Apply gamma correction. Some typical values are 0.7 or 1.4 to thin or darken text rendering.
   `-I`
      Invert colors.
   `-s` [mft5]
      Show various bits of information: `m` for glyph cache and total memory usage, `f` for page features such as whether the page is grayscale or color, `t` for per page rendering times as well statistics, and `5` for md5 checksums of rendered images that can be used to check if rendering has changed.
   `-A` bits
      Specify how many bits of anti-aliasing to use. The default is `8`. `0` means no anti-aliasing, `9` means no anti-aliasing, centre-of-pixel rule, `10` means no anti-aliasing, any-part-of-a-pixel rule.
   `-D`
      Disable use of display lists. May cause slowdowns, but should reduce the amount of memory used.
   `-i`
      Ignore errors.
   `-L`
      Low memory mode (avoid caching objects by clearing cache after each page).
   `-P`
      Run interpretation and rendering at the same time.

----

`file`
   Input file name. The input can be any of the :ref:`document formats supported by MuPDF<supported_document_formats>`.

----

`[pages]`
   Comma separated list of page ranges. The first page is "1", and the last page is "N". The default is "1-N".
