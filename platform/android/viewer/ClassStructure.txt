MuPDFActivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MuPDFActivity is the main activity used when displaying and interacting with a
document. This class is responsible for creating the view hierarchy and the
menus.

Main view classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ReaderView
~~~~~~~~~~
MuPDF uses Android's standard Adapter/AdapterView paradigm, where a subclass of
BaseAdapter supplies multiple views that have their motion on screen
choreographed by a subclass of AdapterView. There are several standard
AdapterView subclasses, but none support zooming into a specific subview and
then panning within it, so MuPDF has its own AdapterView subclass, namely
ReaderView. The class is intended to be general purpose and usable within any
document-viewing application. During page viewing, ReaderView handles all touch
events, recognises gestures and positions the displayed document pages
accordingly. ReaderView needs to handle positioning slightly differently
depending on whether MuPDF is reflowing text or not, and so it has two slightly
different modes of operation.

MuPDFReaderView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MuPDFReaderView subclasses ReaderView, so as to provide some of the
page-positioning behaviour that is specific to MuPDF. It overrides some of the
gesture recognition methods of ReaderView, so that it can perform special
handling of (e.g.) tapping on the side of the screen for page progression, and
tapping on links or form fields. It also handles the disabling of scrolling
during text-selection and annotation-drawing, and it performs the setup
operations needed by the individual page views as each newly appears.

MuPDFView
~~~~~~~~~
Document viewing uses different View subclasses to display the individual pages
depending on whether reflowing text or displaying pages unaltered. MuPDFView is
the common interface to the two view subclasses.

PageView
~~~~~~~~
PageView is the main View class used for non-reflow display of a page. Like
ReaderView, it is intended to be, as much as is possible, independent of the
specifics of MuPDF and usable in general document display apps. It is a
subclass of ViewGroup because page displays are built from several layers. The
lowest layer is a rendering of the page at a resolution that matches the screen
exactly when maximally zoomed out so that the page fits the screen. As the user
zooms in, this layer maintains a visible appearance of the page, but one that
becomes more blurred as zooming in progresses. A second layer provides a higher
resolution rendering of just the area of the page that is visible on screen,
and at a resolution that matches the screen. As the user pans, this layer is
updated on a background thread, so parts of the blurred layer will temporarily
become visible, but only momentarily later to be replaced by the high-quality
rendering. There is one further layer that is used to draw transparent shapes
for highlighting and the like.

MuPDFPageView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MuPDFPageView is a subclass of PageView, which handles some of the specifics of
MuPDF's behaviour, such as taps on links and form fields, text selection, and
annotation drawing. It also handles its parent class's bitmap rendering calls.
This is the class used to display pages in non-reflow mode. It implements the
MuPDFView interface.

MuPDFReflowView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the class used to display pages in reflow mode. Like MuPDFPageView it
implements the MuPDFView interface. It is a subclass of WebView, and achieves
reflowing by loading an HTML version of the page, which the MuPDF core
constructs.

MuPDFPageAdapter and MuPDFReflowAdapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As with any AdapterView subclass, ReaderView needs an Adapter subclass to
supply, on demand, the subviews for the pages currently displayed. These are
the two Adapter subclasses, supplying the subviews as MuPDFPageView and
MuPDFReflowView objects respectively. The former is a little more complex than
the latter, since it caches the sizes of the pages corresponding to the views
it supplies. It does so, so that page views, on their second and subsequent
appearances, can take on their correct size immediately. (The determining of
page size is not a completely trivial operation and is performed on a
background thread, as is all interaction with the core MuPDF library).

C library wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MuPDFCore
~~~~~~~~~
This class is the interface to the MuPDF C library. It is used to render bitmap
versions of the page for display in the view classes mentioned above. It also
provides for interaction with objects within the page, such as the individual
text objects and annotations. Many of the methods take too long an execution
time to be run on the UI thread, hence they need to be run in the background,
and because even the fast methods have to be synchronised with the slower
methods, (almost) all methods should be called in the background. There are a
few non synchronised ones that have special purposes.

Link handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are three types of PDF links, each entailing different information and
requiring different handling. There are five classes involved in their
representation.

LinkInfo is the base class representing any one of the three

LinkInfoExternal, LinkInfoInternal and LinkInfoRemote are the three subclasses
representing the specific cases.

LinkInfoVisitor is a class implementing a common Java paradigm which allows
case analysis on the three different types of link, executing different methods
for each.

BitmapHolder
~~~~~~~~~~~~
BitmapHolder is the solution to a problem in allocating the Bitmaps to which
rendering is performed by background tasks. Renderings for the purpose of
update have to be passed a Bitmap with the current page state.  During frenetic
page flicking a large number of rendering tasks can be queued, each holding
reference to a Bitmap. Rather than pass the Bitmap directly, we pass a
BitmapHolder containing a reference to the Bitmap. When a page view transitions
off screen, the BitmapHolder's reference to the Bitmap can be nulled to release
it.

SearchTask and SearchTaskResult
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SearchTask encapsulates the process of searching for a text string within a
document. The class uses an AsyncTask internally to perform the search in the
background and reports the result by calling onTextFound. A SearchTaskResult
object is used to return the result of the search.

SafeAnimatorInflator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class is a simple wrapper around AnimatorInflator. AnimatorInflator
doesn't exist in some of the Android API levels MuPDF supports, and the wrapper
allows for a test of API-level before the point at which the class would be
loaded.

MuPDFAlert and MuPDFAlertInternal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class represents the information issued by a javascript app.alert call.
MuPDFAlertInternal represents the same information, but with Java enums
replaced by ints, which are easier to return from JNI code.

TextChar and TextWord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TextChar is used when processing the individual characters of the page. Each
TextChar object contains the character and the rectangular area of the page at
which it appears. TextWord is used to gather TextChars into words.

Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~
This class represents the type and position on page of a PDF annotation.

Other activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The app has three activities other than document-viewing.

ChoosePDFActivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChoosePDFActivity allows the user to navigate local disc directories and view a
list of loadable files, from which one can be chosen. It derives off
ListActivity, and so displays the files in a standard ListView. ChoosePDFItem
represents the various types of list entry: up-one, directory or file.
ChoosePDFAdapter populates the list view.

OutlineActivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OutlineActivity displays a PDF document's outline as a list of selectable
section titles. OutlineActivityData represents the current state of the
activity. OutlineItem represents the individual items, and OutlineAdapter
populates the list view.

PrintDialogActivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This activity allows the user to print documents via Google Cloud Print.

Copied system classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsyncTask has had improvements made to it since issuing at the lowest android
API level we support, and so we include the improved version as part of the
MuPDF app. We also include Deque and ArrayDeque, which are used my AsyncTask.
